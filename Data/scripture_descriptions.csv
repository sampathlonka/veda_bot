RigVeda,NULL,NULL,NULL,RigVeda,scripture,"All the mantras used by the priest hot?†to invite the various†deities†to a sacrifice, were collected together and collectively called the ?gveda. Each of its mantras are known as a ë?cí or ë?kí. ?gveda is in the form of†Sukta-s, which mean 'beautiful statements'.†A†collection of beautifully composed ?k-s itself is a†Sukta. ?k refers to an mantras that 'praises' and†Veda†means 'knowledge'. The knowledge of the Suktas itself is the literal meaning of ?gveda. The ?gveda ?ks mostly praise God -- they are filed with good thoughts and have the ability to inspire. The ultimate aim of all these mantras is to purify the human†mind†through knowledge. Darkness is symbol of lack of knowledge or  illusionary living, which makes us devoid of justness and sagacity. Only two shakas of the ?gveda, Shakala sakha and Baskala shaka, remain alive out of the 21 which existed at one time. Ancient tradition has divided the ?gveda samhit? in two different ways. They are: A?taka method - It has been designed to facilitate easy memorization by apportioning more or less equal number of mantras to each section; Mandala method - In this method, the subject is more important. This application displays the Mandala method.",Mandala,0
SamaVeda,NULL,NULL,NULL,SamaVeda,scripture,"The S?maveda or the S?maveda samhit? is the third in the traditional list of the four Vedas. It comprises mostly of the ?gvedic mantras or ?ks, specifically 1504 set to the saptasvara system, to be sung at appropriate places in a sacrifice. It is the udg?t? along with his three assistants that does this. The total number of ?ks in this Veda, as per one calculation, is 1875. It is noteworthy that this Veda has been eulogized highly in the other Vedas. K???a, while describing his special aspects, says in the Bhagavadg?t? that he is S?maveda among the Vedas.
Like three other Vedas, the S?maveda also has several ??kh?s. Though some traditional works like the Cara?a-vyuha mention that there are a thousand ??kh?s in the S?maveda, only thirteen names have been discovered so far. Nevertheless, only three such ??kh?s are extant now. They are:
Jaimin?ya??kh?
Kauthuma??kh?
R?n?yaniya??kh?
The S?maveda has two sections called Purv?rcik? and Uttar?rcik?. The Purv?rcik? has several prap??hakas or chapters containing few da?atis. The da?atis are comprised of ?ks. The Uttar?rcik? has nine prap??hakas. These are divided into kha??as, each of which consists of a large number of ?ks. In the Purv?rcik?, the mantras taken from the ?gveda have been regrouped according to the devat? or the deity praised.

The first prap??haka contains mantras connected with Agni and hence called ?gneyak?nda.

Prap?thakas 2 to 4 are known as Aindrak?nda since they are devoted to Indra, the king of gods.

The fifth prap??haka contains mantras dedicated to the god Soma-Pavam?na and hence called Pavam?naparva, in which most of these mantras have been taken from the ninth ma?dala of the ?gveda, which is entirely devoted to that deity.

The ?ks of these five prap??hakas are known as veyag?na or gr?mag?na or gr?megeya because they are to be sung in gr?mas or villages and towns.

The sixth prap??haka is called Ara?yak?nda or ?ra?yakaparva. These mantras have to be chanted in an ara?ya or forest, since they are conducive to contemplation.

The ten ?ks appearing at the end of this section are known as Mah?n?mn? like an appendix to the Purv?rcik?. They are also known as ?akvaryah.  In the Uttar?rcik?, there are nine prap??hakas. Each prap??haka has several kha??as like the da?atis of the Purv?rcik? which contain the ?ks. The chanting or singing of these ?ks is divided into two groups:

Uhag?na - The basic model for this is the gr?mag?na.
Uhyag?na or rahasyag?na - The basic model for this is the ara?yag?na.",Archikah,0

AtharvaVeda,NULL,NULL,NULL,AtharvaVeda,scripture,"The Atharvaveda has been called by several other names : Atharvanaveda - The word ëAtharvan,í is derived from ëathar,í which is an obsolete word for fire. It means ëthe priest of fire.í; Atharv?Ògi- rasa - Atharvan is identified with A?giras and also called Atharv??girasa; ?Ògirasa - Sage ?Ògirasa was one the ëdra???rasí of this Veda; BhrgvaÒgirasa - Sage Bh?gu also revealed various hymns of this Veda; Bhrgu-vistara - As sage Bh?gu revealed various hymns it was also named as Bhrguvistara; Brahmaveda - The title ëBrahmavedaí is related to the priest brahm?, the fourth of the four priests in the group; Bhaisajyaveda - This name has been derived from the subject matter of the Veda which contains material on bhai?ajya(medicines and treatment); Ksattraveda - This name originates from the matter revealed in the Veda which contains information about the ëk?attraí (the warrior-class known as the k?attriyas);

The Atharvaveda has some special features because of which it stands a little apart from the other three Vedas, especially the Rigveda. Major portion of this Veda is concerned with the following : 

Diseases and their cure
Rites for prolonging life
Rites for fulfilling oneís desires
Building construction
Trade and commerce
Statecraft
Penances
Propitiatory rites
Black-magic
From the ancient times, nine ??kh?s or branches of the Atharvaveda (Samhit?) are known to have existed. However, only two of them are extant :

Pippal?da
?aunaka
Of these, only ?aunaka is available in a complete form. This Veda is divided into four ëprap?thakas,í comprising 20 ëk???as.í Each k???a is again sub-divided into ësuktasí and these suktas, into ëmantras.í   This gives us 6,077 mantras in 736 suktas spread over 20 k???as in 4 prap??hakas. However, due to the different methods adopted in grouping or classifying, the number of suktas given by various scholars varies from 598 to 759. But there is no difference in the number of the mantras. The last k???a, i.e., the 20th, has borrowed it thoughts heavily (to the tune of 90%) from the Rigveda Samhit?. It is opined that the k??das 19 and 20, sometimes termed as ëKhilak???a,í are later additions to this Veda.

The subject matter of the Samhit? of this Veda has no systematic division in the first twelve k???as. The last two again, deal with miscellaneous topics. However, there are eight topics that are covered:

Bhaisajya: diseases, their causes and cures
?yusya: supplications for longevity
Paustika: worldly progress and welfare
?bhic?rika: destroy or harm enemies who obstruct progress
Pr?ya?citta: expiatory rites
R?jakarma: political system
Brahmanya : nature of Brahman, the Absolute.
Bhaisajya Suktas

These suktas deal with diseases, their causes and cures, show a remarkable insight into the subject of health sciences. That is why this Veda is considered to be the precursor of Ayurveda or the Science of health and longevity. Sometimes, Ayurveda is listed as an Upaveda or subsidiary of the Atharvaveda. These suktas contain many prayers for health and longevity. The various names of the parts of the body given here bespeak of an intimate knowledge of human anatomy. Several diseases like fever, leucoderma, leprosy, jaundice, diabetes, dropsy, skin disorders, troubles of the ear, nose and throat, fracture of bones, diseases of the heart and tuberculosis, are mentioned with their respective cures. These diseases are caused by germs, violation of the laws of nature, anger of deities, malevolent spirits and sins committed previously. Apart from medicines and physical remedies, use of chants and charms was also in plenty. A deep knowledge of the herbs and their various medicinal properties can be inferred from many of the mantras.

?yusya Suktas

These suktas contain supplications for longevity. They are to be uttered on auspicious occasions like caula (tonsure), upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread), god?na (gifting of cows) and so on. The desire to live the full span of life, viz., 100 years, is often expressed. One of the suktas indicates to wear the ërak??sutraí (ëthread of protectioní) on the body to attain longevity.

Paustika Suktas

Pu??i means worldly progress and welfare. These suktas generally contain prayers for the blessings of deities like the Maruts, Parjanya and others so that there can be good rains. Due to these rains crops and works like house-building, agriculture and trade flourishes well. The auspicious rites described in the Pau??ika Suktas are called ë?uklendraj?la.í

?bhic?rika Suktas

The ?bhic?raka Suktas are aimed to destroy or harm enemies who obstruct our progress or try to destroy us. This is said to be achieved by pleasing or appeasing certain deities or spirits and getting oneís wishes fulfilled through them. This technique is called ëy?tuí or ëk?ty?.í The number of such suktas is rather large. Destruction of oneís enemies including the lovers of oneís spouse, annihilation of evil spirits, mesmerizing others through whom one can get oneís desires fulfilled are some of the topics dealt with in these suktas. The word ëk???endraj?laí is sometimes used to indicate the type of black-magic rites depicted here.

Pr?ya?citta Suktas

These are concerned mainly with expiatory rites to offset the evil effects due to non-performance or wrong performance of religious rites. Omens foreboding evil and the rites necessary to combat them are also described.

Strikarma Suktas : These suktas deal mainly with marriage, love and allied topics. Rites that help in regaining the lost love of oneís spouse are also described.
R?jakarma Suktas

This section gives an account of the political system during those days. The king was elected by the people. National and social problems were discussed by or decided in a ësamitií, a parliament of the people. The R?japuro- hita (Chief Priest of the State) had an enviable place in the affairs of the State. Prayers for victory in war and hymns expressing devotion to the Motherland given here are highly poetic and moving.

Brahmanya Suktas

These suktas unfold the nature of Brahman, the Absolute. The philosophical ideas given here form a link ideas of the Rigvedaand the Upani?ads. Peculiarity of this Veda is the names designated to God - K?la, Skambha, Ucchi??a and Vr?tya. The whole universe is emerges and established by him. He is the lord of the whole creation. He has evolved the universe. The sun is a symbol of his power and is called ëRohita,í the ëRed-Oneí. He is identified with God himself. This Absolute is also identified with the Atman. The word ëVr?tyaí found in this section has nothing to do with the people who had been without Vedic sacraments, the sense in which the word has been used in the dharma??stras. Here it represents Brahman, the Absolute.",Kandah,0
